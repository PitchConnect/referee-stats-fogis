# Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

## Description

To prevent code quality issues from being pushed to the repository, we should implement pre-commit hooks that run the same checks as the CI pipeline. This will help catch issues early in the development process and ensure that all code meets the project's quality standards.

## Tasks

- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for:
  - [ ] flake8 for linting
  - [ ] black for code formatting
  - [ ] isort for import sorting
  - [ ] mypy for type checking
- [ ] Add a pre-commit configuration file (.pre-commit-config.yaml)
- [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md with instructions for setting up pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Ensure hooks match CI pipeline checks to prevent CI failures

## Related Issues

- #16 Implement data import functionality (where we encountered linting and type hint issues)

## Benefits

- Catches issues before they're committed
- Ensures consistent code style across the project
- Reduces CI failures due to code quality issues
- Improves developer experience by providing immediate feedback
